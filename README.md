## Setup
This is a website thus is not available for download and can only be accessed online. However, we are working on building a functional app so stay tuned.

## Technologies used
- [HTML & CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_css.asp) - HTML is used to make the backbone of the website which mainly includes the text whereas CSS is used in styling the HTML document.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Bootsrap acts as a framework in building the site especially when it comes to object positioning and responsivity of the site.
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) - This helps in hiding and showing elements and also in clearing forms after submission.

## Dependencies
The site uses mailchimp API to track the emails sent from the 'Contact us' section.
